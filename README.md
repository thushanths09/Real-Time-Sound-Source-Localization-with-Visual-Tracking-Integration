# 🎧 Real-Time Sound Source Localization with Visual Tracking Integration

A **real-time audio–visual perception system** that localizes and tracks active sound sources by fusing **microphone-array–based signal processing** with **camera-based directional visual tracking**. The system estimates the **2D spatial location (x, y)** of sound sources using audio signals, while visual information is used **only to identify and track the direction of the sound-emitting object**, improving robustness and temporal stability in dynamic environments.

## 📌 Project Overview

Sound source localization using microphones alone is highly sensitive to noise, reverberation, and spatial ambiguity. This project addresses these limitations by combining **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)–based audio localization** with **vision-based directional tracking**.

The system performs **metric localization in the (x, y) plane using audio signals**, derived from microphone-array geometry and Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) measurements. A camera-based vision module operates in parallel to **identify and track the direction of the sound source in the visual field**, enabling validation, refinement, and stabilization of the audio-based estimates.

The system combines:
- **Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA)**–based audio localization  
- **Angle of Arrival (AoA)** and geometry-based **(x, y) position estimation**  
- **Vision-based directional tracking** to associate sound sources with visual targets  

This audio–visual framework is suitable for **assistive technologies, robotics, surveillance, and research applications**.

## ⚙️ System Functionality & Working

The system operates in real time using a synchronized **multi-microphone array** and a camera module. Audio signals captured by spatially separated microphones are processed frame-by-frame to estimate **inter-microphone time delays**. These delays are used to compute the **Angle of Arrival (AoA)** and subsequently infer the **2D spatial location (x, y)** of the sound source using array geometry.

To improve robustness, the audio pipeline incorporates **FIR-based filtering and spectral conditioning**, ensuring reliable delay estimation under noise and reverberation. In parallel, the vision pipeline performs **directional visual tracking**, identifying the angular direction of candidate sound-emitting objects within the camera frame.

The **fusion layer aligns the audio-derived direction and (x, y) position with the vision-based direction**, enabling stable tracking even when one modality is temporarily degraded. Vision is not used for metric distance estimation, but strictly for **directional confirmation and temporal association**.
